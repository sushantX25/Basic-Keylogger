**📜 Keylogger Description (For GitHub Repository)**  

**🛡️ Basic Keylogger (Educational Purpose Only)**  

This repository contains a **basic keylogger** built using Python. It records keystrokes and saves them to a log file for analysis.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational and ethical hacking purposes only**. Do not use it for malicious activities.

**🔹 Features**  
✅ Logs all keystrokes in the background  
✅ Saves logs to a `.txt` file  
✅ Lightweight and runs silently  
✅ Simple implementation with minimal dependencies

**⚙️ Installation & Usage**  

#### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
Ensure Python is installed, then install the required package:  
```bash
pip install pynput
```

**2️⃣ Run the Script**  
```bash
python keylogger.py
```

**3️⃣ View Keystroke Logs**  
All logged keystrokes will be saved in `log.txt`.  

---

**📌 How It Works?**  
- Uses the `pynput` library to listen to keystrokes  
- Captures each keypress and stores it in a text file  
- Runs in the background until manually stopped  

---

**🔐 Ethical Usage Guidelines**  
- Do **not** use this on someone else’s device without permission.  
- This tool is meant for learning **cybersecurity concepts**, not illegal use.

**📂 Files Included**  
📌 `keylogger.py` – The main script  
📌 `log.txt` – File where keystrokes are stored (created automatically)
